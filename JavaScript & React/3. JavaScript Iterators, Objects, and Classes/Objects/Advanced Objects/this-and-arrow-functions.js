// Arrow functions inherently bind, or tie, an already defined this value to the function itself that is NOT the calling object. In the code snippet above, the value of this is the global object, or an object that exists in the global scope, which doesnâ€™t have a dietType property and therefore returns undefined.

// avoid using arrow functions when using this in a method!!!!
const robot = {
    energyLevel: 100,
    checkEnergy() {
        console.log(`Energy is currently at ${this.energyLevel}%.`)
    }
}

robot.checkEnergy();
