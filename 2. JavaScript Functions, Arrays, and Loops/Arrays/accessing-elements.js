// Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the itemâ€™s position.

// Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0

const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];
const listItem = famousSayings[0];

console.log(famousSayings[2]);
console.log(listItem);
