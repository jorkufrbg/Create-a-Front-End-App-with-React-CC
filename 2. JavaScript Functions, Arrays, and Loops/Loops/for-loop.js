// The typical for loop includes an iterator variable that usually appears in all three expressions. The iterator variable is initialized, checked against the stopping condition, and assigned a new value on each loop iteration. Iterator variables can have any name, but itâ€™s best practice to use a descriptive variable name.

for (let i = 5; i < 11; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
