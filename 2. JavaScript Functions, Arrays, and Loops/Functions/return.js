// When a function is called, the computer will run through the functionâ€™s code and evaluate the result of calling the function. By default that resulting value is undefined.

function rectangleArea(width, height) {
    let area = width * height;
}
console.log(rectangleArea(5, 7)) // Prints undefined

//   To pass back information from the function call, we use a return statement. To create a return statement, we use the return keyword followed by the value that we wish to return. Like we saw above, if the value is omitted, undefined is returned instead.

// When a return statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped and the code that follows it will not be executed.


function monitorCount(rows, columns) {
    return rows * columns;

const numOfMonitors = monitorCount(5, 4);

console.log(numOfMonitors);
